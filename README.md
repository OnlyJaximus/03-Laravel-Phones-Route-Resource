# 03-Laravel-Phones-Route-Resource

This mini application is made in Laravel. MySQL is used as a database. Bootstrap was used for the layout of the pages. In this application, a CRUD system was created using the route resource.
In this application, two methods are used for database communication: ROW SQL and QueryBuilder.

-The Route::resource method is a RESTful Controller that generates all the basic routes required for an application and can be easily handled using the controller class.
php artisan make:controller PhotoController --resource
